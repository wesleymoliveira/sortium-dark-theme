# README

## This is a DARK theme based on Sortium brand colors.

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts(if you want to edit it):

- Preview changes in the editor using Debugger (`F5` on Windows and Linux)

- Targetting styles to a text: use (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux) and type: 'Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes'. That way you can see the name of the scope and change it on 'Sortium Blockchain Studio Dark-color-theme.json' (Syntax highlighting only)

- VSCode Application colors:
  [Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color)

  ```
